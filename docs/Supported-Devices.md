# Supported Devices

The Kasa Collector currently supports collecting data from the following Kasa devices:

- [KP115](https://www.kasasmart.com/us/products/smart-plugs/kasa-smart-plug-slim-energy-monitoring-kp115)
- [HS300](https://www.kasasmart.com/us/products/smart-plugs/kasa-smart-wi-fi-power-strip-hs300)
- [KP125M](https://www.tp-link.com/us/home-networking/smart-plug/kp125m/)

These devices have been tested personally, and others may be supported based on the "energy" tag found during device discovery.
